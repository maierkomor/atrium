R2002:
======
- added option to restore relay state on power-up
- added command to modify MAC addresses
- fix: version not picked up correctly from repository
- hostname must be possible to query without privileges
- added support to set domainname, use domainname for host lookups
- changed setupenv.sh to pick esp8266/v3.2 idf, because
  v3.3 produces corrupt OTA binaries
