Startup procedure:
==================

This file describes the dependencies in the startup process. It may not
be fully up-to-date and should only give an insight of what is
happening.

- The primary initialization is done by IDF code
- The Atrium startup procedure begins with entering app_main()
- log core infratstructure is initialized (mutex, uart driver)
- event infrastructure is setup (mutex,queue,basic events)
- message log buffer is initialized (mutex, message events)
- global variables (config,env) are initialized with defaults
- NVS is initialized and the hardware config is read
- remaining UARTs are initialized
- Atrium reports its version
- action infrastructure
- init software configuration
- start cyclic tasks infrastructure
- core driver init (GPIO,ADC,Hall,Status LED)
- mount file-system
- start console
- start event processing
- setup at-service (calender/time based actions)
- setup near hardware drivers (relays,buttons,dimmer,DHT)
- scan I2C bus
- touchpad init
- 1-wire init and scan 
- WiFi startup station/soft-AP
- activate configuratoin
- core network services start (uDNS,SNTP,Syslog,MQTT,Influx)
- init remaining drivers
- start display driver and application
- setup state-machines
- activate user-configured actions (depends on all defined actions and
  events)
- start remaining network services (Telnet,HTTP,FTP,UDP remote-control port)
