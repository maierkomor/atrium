synopsis: format <partition> [<fs>]
Format the specified partition with filesystem <fs>. <fs> must only
be passed if multiple filesystems are supported by the firmware. 
Before formatting the partition, it must be erased with the "part"
command or with an external tool. After formatting the partition,
the system must be rebooted to mount the partition.
